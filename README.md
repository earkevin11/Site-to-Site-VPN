# Site-to-Site-VPN

# What is the purpose of a Site-to-Site VPN connection?
- Site-to-site VPN is used when you want to connect an large infrastructures like an entire on-premise data center to a virtual network

# Same as point-to-site, we will use a Virtual Network gateway 

# Continuation of Point-to-Site VPN connection demo
# Use Case: Simulate a company setup 
- Create a new VM that will act as the company on a new network

- On-Prem company setup will need a routing device that has public IP address
- Install Windows Server 2019 which will have the public IP address 
- Select "Remote Access" > Select DirectAccess and VPN and Routing > Install
- This will route traffic via the site-to-site VPN connection

# Create a Local Network Gateway
- It will have information about the company setup and will be attached on the virtual network gateway
- It will understand the client's network details
- Add the public IP address of companyvm 
- Address space: is the private IP address space of companyvm

# Take the public IP of companyvm and use it as the IP address for the local network gateway

# Configure the routing service on the simulated company setup
- Scroll to the right hand corner and open the getting started wizard 
- Select deploy VPN only > right click on companyvm > configure and enable routing and remote access > custom configuration > demand-dial connection and LAN routing 
- Start the service

# Now admins must give information about the azure side similar to how we input all of the companyvm info into the local gateway
- Admins must add routing details

# Navigate within companyvm to the point-to-sitevm's private ip address
- 10.0.0.4/vpn%20connection%20point%20to%20site.html
- ^ Remember, this is the HTML page that you created
- There is a successful site-to-site connection once users can reach the private IP webpage

# We can also set up a peering connection to a virtual network and companyvm can still access it
- We're not going to to the demo.
